            <h3>Inside Out: the unexpected beuty of Character</h3>
        </div>
        <img src="./Image.png" alt="">
        <p>When we were young, we may have been taught memorable phrases that emphasised certain qualities: the need to be kind, to share what we have with those around us, and to treat others as we would like to be treated. At the time, the importance of these character traits may not have taken shape fully - maybe these acts were simply the nice or polite thing to do. As we grow older, the weight of our character sinks in deeper. Particularly in a society that spotlights outward ‚Äòsuccess‚Äô (things like our giftedness or material possessions), our character holds unique value. It is a quiet strength that permeates every area of our lives. Regardless of what we have to offer by way of society‚Äôs success measures, character forms the backbone of how we approach what arises in our day to day experience.</p>
        <h3>Valuing Our Inner selves</h3>
        <p>
            The appeal of cultivating our inner selves is not always strong. It is a commitment that may not be seen immediately, holding less of a priority amongst other pursuits. But what if our character is a solid foundation on which everything else is built? The skills and talents we are diligent in honing can be made better by a reputation we are also persistent in caring for. This is a gift that God prizes. <br>
            The life of King David, a biblical figure best known for defeating a large giant named Goliath, was marked by a strong character in his youth. Before he was chosen as the next king of Israel, he was overlooked by people who did not think he held the ‚Äúlook‚Äù of a king. But in the story, which can be read in 1 Samuel 16, God says, ‚ÄòFor the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart‚Äô (1 Samuel 16:7). While our character is not always seen right away, it can be sensed and felt by others. It can lead us into positions that we never thought we would hold.
        </p>
        <h3>Lighting The Path</h3>
        <p>
            In the Bible, there is a book of writings on wisdom, named Proverbs, that makes a connection between our character and where we are headed: ‚ÄòThe integrity of the honest keeps them on track‚Äô (Proverbs 11:3.) How many of us have experienced moments in decision-making that left us at a crossroads? Moments where we were faced with difficult choices and questioned how we would manage? In these times, our character may not be the first consideration, but it can be the driving force in how we decide which road to take. We can think of our character as our initial reflex - the way that we have been developing it is the way that we will often react to what may arise in our lives. Choosing to operate from the disciplines of our character (the likes of fairness, honesty, care, etc), helps us to remain focused in our decision making. It is similar to a protective measure that keeps us from straying too far from what we value.
        </p>
        <h3>Character produces ope in our lives</h3>
        <p>
            The idea of paying attention to our character is not solely for the benefit of navigation. Its beauty truly lies in what it eventually produces within us: hope. Our character has the power to change the way that we see ourselves, our circumstances, and the world around us. Another book of the Bible, Romans, shares it this way: ‚Äò‚Ä¶endurance produces character, and character produces hope‚Äô (Romans 5:4.) What makes us continue to seek what is good even when everything around us shows otherwise? The answer goes back to what we have been developing inside ourselves. Our hope represents our confidence - an assuredness and expectation towards the future. If we have managed to come out on the other side of difficult situations before, then maybe we will be more inclined to take on the challenges that we face in the future. The testing of our character plays a part in shaping this kind of outlook. <br><br>
            So, why does our character count? It is admittedly a clich√© question - until we see it lived out. Through our character, we see that the very nature of who we are can be a source of strength, guidance, and foundation throughout our lives. Whether we find ourselves desiring to go to a new level in business, or seeking to grow in our relationship with others, our character is the transferrable quality that we take with us everywhere we go.
